    "\n",
    "Alex had a knack for dropping everything he touched. Books, pens, bags—you name it, he'd probably sent it flying. His friends affectionately called him “Hurricane Alex” because even a simple handshake often led to something toppling over. Mia, on the other hand, was known for tripping over absolutely nothing. Her shoelaces always seemed to untie themselves, and she had a record of accidentally walking into doorframes more times than anyone could count.\n",
    "\n",
    "One rainy afternoon, fate decided to have a little fun. Alex was rushing to get home, arms full of groceries, when his foot caught a puddle. Meanwhile, Mia, who was distracted tying her rebellious laces, stumbled forward. In what could only be described as a perfectly choreographed moment of clumsy elegance, Alex’s groceries flew into the air as Mia fell into him. Apples rolled down the sidewalk, a bag of flour burst open like a miniature snowstorm, and they both landed on the wet ground in a tangled heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a moment, silence reigned as rain tapped softly on their heads. Then, Mia started to giggle. Alex looked at her, flour coating his hair, and couldn’t help but burst into laughter too. From that day on, they became inseparable—not because they stopped being clumsy, but because they realized life’s tumbles are far better shared.\"\"\""

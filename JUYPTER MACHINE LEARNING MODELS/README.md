# Machine Learning Project Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning project repository! This repository contains beginner-friendly code examples, explanations, and hands-on exercises to help you get started on your machine learning journey.

Some of my models are lost due to some technical error I will upload them soon.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data without being explicitly programmed. This repository is designed to make learning easy and engaging for beginners.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for running code interactively): [Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install)

Basic understanding of programming concepts is helpful, but no prior machine learning knowledge is needed!


## Project Overview

This project provides various beginner-friendly machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. It includes practical exercises that help you understand concepts such as data preprocessing, building models, and evaluating algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN, and more. This is a great resource for anyone starting their machine learning journey.


## Contents

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with hands-on machine learning exercises.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of required libraries for this project.
- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, with setup and usage instructions.


## Quick Start

1. Open any Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks/ folder.
2. Follow the instructions and run each cell step-by-step.
3. Experiment with the code to learn and improve your understanding of machine learning.

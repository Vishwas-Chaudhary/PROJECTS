##  Project Purpose

This project was designed to demonstrate our **Data Structures & Algorithms** skills in a practical setting. We were tasked with using **Huffman Coding**, so we built a full-stack chat application that supports **compressed text file transfers** using Huffman-based encoding.

Weâ€™ve currently used **MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL)** as the backend database, but we plan to switch to a **SQL-based** alternative in future versions for enhanced relational data handling.

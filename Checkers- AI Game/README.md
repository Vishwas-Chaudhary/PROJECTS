## Overview
A simple checkers game where the player plays against an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible moves.

## Features
- Player vs AI gameplay
- AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with a single difficulty level difficulty can be easily change by altering the depth of the decesion tree but more depth means slower execution of the program so, I have set the depth to 4 in order to make this game feel enjoyable.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
